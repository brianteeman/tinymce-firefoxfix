# tinymce-firefoxfix

For Joomla 5.4.3 users experiencing a _flashing_ problem when editing content using tinyMCE the files contained here will fix it for you. They are the same files that will be available in the next release of Joomla so they are sage to install.

Download the zip file and extract the contents `tinymce.js` and `tinymce.min.js` and upload them to your site int the `media\plg_editors_tinymce\js` folder to **replace** the two files with the same name.
